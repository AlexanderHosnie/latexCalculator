# latexCalculator
This is a calculator that formats mathmatical expressions in the way you would normally write them down with pen and paper. </br>
So instead of having to type lame stuff like: </br>
`((2+33)/114)*sqrt(25)` </br>
You would **elegantly** type: </br>
![Alt text](/latexMath.png?raw=true "Latex Math")
</br>

This project is based on the beautiful [MathQuill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill) library.

## TODO:
* [ ] Create an engine that would parse the latex code and produce a result accordingly.
* [ ] Create the UI, the buttons and all.
* [ ] Find a suitable framework to port it to desktop. ex: AppJS, electron... etc.
